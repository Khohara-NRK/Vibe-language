# 🌊 Vibe: The Intent-Oriented Programming (IOP) Language

**"Stop coding. Start vibing."**

Vibe is the world’s first programming language designed for humans, not machines. It treats the developer (a "Viber") as a Director and the compiler as an intelligent Agent. By using natural language structures and a hybrid neural runtime, Vibe allows you to build cross-platform applications (Web, Mobile, Desktop) without ever worrying about memory management, syntax errors, or platform-specific boilerplate.

## 🚀 The Core Philosophy
Traditional languages (C, Python, JS) force you to think like a processor. Vibe forces the processor to think like you.

- **Human-Native:** If you can say it, you can code it.
- **Agentic Logic:** The compiler doesn't just parse text; it understands intent.
- **Creative vs. Strict:** Use `~` for AI-assisted design and `!` for mission-critical logic.

## 🛠 The Syntax (The Viber Guide)

### 1. The Operators
- `~` (The Vibe): Creative compilation. "Make it look cool."
- `!` (The Force): Strict logic. "This must be exactly 10."
- `>` (The Action): Execute a command or tool call.

### 2. Iterative Intent (No more Loops)
Forget `for`, `while`, or `map`. Just tell Vibe to repeat.
- `Repeat 5 times: > Print "Hello"`
- `Every item in MyList: ~ Show as a stylish card.`
- `Always: > Check the server status.`

### 3. The Goal Block
Every `.vibe` file starts with a vision.
